          <div class="article-content">
            <p>
              "Brain rot" is a slang term that is commonly used among Gen Z and Generation Alpha who are 
              active on online social media platforms. It is used to describe the effects of being “perpetually online” 
              and consuming large amounts of low-quality online content. These slang words are commonly used in online 
              applications such as TikTok, Snapchat, Youtube, Discord, and gaming communities. 

            </p>

            <p>
              The term “brainrot” has been used online since at least 2004, but it became more popular in the 2010s and became 
              a hit and an internet meme in 2023! It is frequently used to discuss hobbies, favorite media, or niche interests. 
              Brainrot is used to convey both enthusiasm and self-awareness. It is often a playful or sarcastic way to admit 
              to being "rotted" or consumed by the internet.
