          <div class="article-content">
            <p>
              In today’s world, we’re constantly plugged into screens –the constant buzz of
              notifications that you just can’t resist, doom-scrolling on TikTok ‘til no one knows
              when, and especially the newest terms of the latest generation that you see and hear
              almost EVERYWHERE. But behind the scenes, there’s a pressing issue that needs to be
              addressed: <a class="brainrot" href="article2.html">‘brainrot’</a>. For adults, it is
              already mentally draining to know just the basic terms of ‘brainrot’, but for children
              whose brains are still developing, the effects can be even more severe.
            </p>

            <p>
              The effects of ‘brainrot’ is more than just losing focus. Brain development is a complex
              process and the constant bombardment of digital content can interfere with how children’s
              brains process information, make decisions, and develop social and emotional skills.

                <h3>1. Reduced Attention Span</h3>
                <p>
              Brainrot is closely linked to how modern digital culture operates. Social media, games, 
			  and apps are specifically designed to capture attention and keep users returning for more.
			  The constant stream of continuous quick, bite-sized content trains children’s brains to 
			  seek immediate rewards, conditioning their minds to crave constant stimulation, making it 
			  harder to concentrate on tasks that require more time or deeper thought.

                <h3>2. Difficulty in Social Interactions</h3>
                <p>
                 With how kids stick to their screens 24/7, it is increasingly difficult for them to build
				 real connections and develop essential social skills.​ The reliance on digital communication 
				 often replaces face-to-face interactions. Without these interactions, children may struggle 
				 to express their emotions effectively or to engage in meaningful conversations. 
                </p>

              <div class="section" id="section3">
                <h3>3. Making Decisions</h3>
                <p>
                 The digital environment encourages quick thinking and immediate responses, which can
				 foster impulsive behavior rather than thoughtful analysis. ​When children frequently 
				 consume information on screens—be it through social media, gaming, or streaming—decisions 
				 are often made based on fleeting trends or emotional impulses instead of critical thinking.
