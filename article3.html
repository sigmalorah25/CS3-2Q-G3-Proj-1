                <h3>1. Lower problem-solving abilities</h3>
                <p>
              It is more difficult to understand and focus on certain tasks that 
			require a profusion of mental effort to complete such tasks in school.

                <h3>2.  Lack of Attention Span</h3>
                <p>
                 Students lack attention span due to the loss of focus that brain rot gives to the student.

                 Chances are, it might be hard for the student to remember the details of the lecture because of 
			too much exposure on the internet to its absurd content.

                <p>
                 Awareness of these issues is important as it may affect the student's learning, causing them to fail academically. 
			Students must lessen the use of gadgets to help themselves in the near future in order for them to succeed in their studies.
